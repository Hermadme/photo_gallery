Photo Gallery plugin for WonderCMS

I needed a photo gallery in WonderCMS where I can upload photos easily and create albums. I began with the upload plugin and extended it with an input field where you can enter an album name. Then I made the part to display images on the screen and the ability to miove and delete these photos and albums.
I am not a professional programmer, therefore I now that a lot of things could be programmed better. I invite erverone to look at this program and make it better.
